# Petrascheck-et-al.-2007

This repo examines a paper published in Nature by Petrascheck et al. (2007) discussing results of research done on Caenorhabditis elegans. They found that antidepressants significantly extend C. elegan lifespan. However, subsequent research (Zarse and Ristow, 2008) failed to produce the same results. We assessed Petrascheck et al.'s (2007) work and determined if any questionable research practices were at play (see *PreregChallengeFinal.Rmd*). We used the paper to complete a Nature reporting summary as well (*Completed_reporting_summary.pdf*). Basic infomraiton onf hthe paper and our initial thoughts on replicability can be found in *Project02.Rmd*. In the *Replication.Rmd* file we discuss the issues brought up in later papers relating to reproducibility. While several factors are at play,the role of Caenorhabditis strain plays a larger role than anticipated by Petrascheck et al. (2007) and other researchers working with this study species at the time. 

All relevant papers are included in the repo, including *Petrascheck.pdf*, the original paper and its supplementary materials *Petrascheck_sup.mat.html*
It shoudl be noted that the online version of the origioanl article also contains more methods information than the PDF. 
Those papers related to questionable research practices are preceded by QRP
*QRP_Zarse&Ristow_2008* - fails to replicate the Petrascheck et al. 2007 results
*QRP_Lithgow_et_al_2017* and *QRP_Lucanic_et_al_2017* both discuss the reproducibility issues associated with Caenorhabditis research
